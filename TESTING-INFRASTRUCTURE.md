## 🛡️ Focus API Protection System

### Historical Problem
The Focus module previously suffered from missing API endpoints:
- `/api/focus/profile` → 404 Not Found
- `/api/focus/achievements` → 404 Not Found  
- `/api/focus/analytics` → 404 Not Found

### Multi-Layer Protection

#### Layer 1: Local Scripts
- ✅ `regression-test.sh` tests all 4 Focus endpoints
- ✅ `test-suite.sh` includes dedicated Focus endpoint section
- ✅ `health-check.sh` provides Focus-specific diagnostics

#### Layer 2: CI/CD Workflows  
- ✅ **Regression Tests** check Focus endpoints on every commit
- ✅ **Focus Monitor** runs every 6 hours with detailed validation
- ✅ **Full Test Suite** tests Focus integration comprehensively
- ✅ **Connectivity Check** ensures environment doesn't break Focus access

#### Layer 3: Documentation
- ✅ **Feature Inventory** documents all Focus endpoints as CRITICAL
- ✅ **Troubleshooting Guide** has dedicated Focus 404 error section
- ✅ **Testing Guide** includes Focus-specific test procedures

#### Layer 4: Monitoring
- ✅ **Status badges** show Focus monitoring health
- ✅ **Workflow artifacts** retain Focus testing history
- ✅ **Automated alerts** trigger on Focus endpoint failures

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### Before Making Changes:
```bash
# Quick smoke test (30 seconds)
./regression-test.sh

# If changes affect Focus module
./focus-endpoint-check.sh  # (custom script for Focus)
```

### After Making Changes:
```bash
# Full validation (2-5 minutes)
./test-suite.sh

# Check specific functionality
./health-check.sh
```

### Before Deploying:
```bash
# Manual workflow triggers via GitHub Actions UI:
# 1. Run "Full Test Suite" workflow
# 2. Run "Focus Endpoint Monitor" workflow  
# 3. Verify all badges are green
```

## 📊 Testing Coverage

### API Endpoints (19 endpoints tested)
- ✅ Core: `/api/{tasks,projects,habits}`
- ✅ Focus: `/api/focus/{profile,achievements,analytics,sessions}`
- ✅ Extended: `/api/{financial,shopping,recipes,analytics}`

### CRUD Operations
- ✅ Task creation, update, deletion
- ✅ Habit tracking and entries
- ✅ Project management
- ✅ Focus session management

### System Components
- ✅ Database connectivity and schema
- ✅ Frontend accessibility and build
- ✅ API server health and CORS
- ✅ Environment configuration precedence

### Dependencies
- ✅ Drag & drop libraries (@dnd-kit/*)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ React development server
- ✅ PostgreSQL database via Docker

## 🔧 Maintenance Schedule

### Daily (Automated)
- Regression tests run at 6 AM UTC
- Status badges update at midnight UTC

### Every 2 Hours (Automated)  
- API connectivity checks
- Environment validation

### Every 6 Hours (Automated)
- Focus endpoint monitoring
- Performance testing

### Weekly (Manual)
- Review workflow failure patterns
- Update test data if needed

### Monthly (Manual)
- Review and update documentation
- Check artifact storage usage
- Update workflow dependencies

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### If Focus 404 Errors Return:
1. **Immediate:** Check Focus Monitor workflow results
2. **Diagnose:** Run `./regression-test.sh` locally
3. **Fix:** Verify Focus endpoints in the TS server (`server/src/**`) if enabled, or ensure the client uses Supabase paths when no REST focus module exists.
4. **Validate:** Run `./test-suite.sh` after fixes
5. **Monitor:** Check Focus Monitor workflow passes

### If All Tests Start Failing:
1. **Check:** GitHub Actions service status
2. **Verify:** Recent commits for breaking changes
3. **Local:** Run `./health-check.sh` for diagnostics
4. **Environment:** Check for .env.local conflicts
5. **Escalate:** Contact repository maintainers

### If Environment Issues Detected:
1. **Run:** API Connectivity Check workflow manually
2. **Check:** `.env.local` for localhost overrides
3. **Fix:** Use `./fix-api-connection.sh`
4. **Verify:** All environment files aligned
