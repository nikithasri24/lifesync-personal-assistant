# ProjectTracking Component Testing Guide

This document explains the comprehensive testing suite created for the ProjectTracking component to ensure all functionalities remain intact even when UI changes are made.

## Overview

The testing suite consists of multiple test files covering different aspects of the ProjectTracking component:

- **ProjectTracking.test.tsx** - Main functionality tests
- **ProjectTracking.dragdrop.test.tsx** - Drag and drop specific tests  
- **ProjectTracking.advanced.test.tsx** - Advanced scenarios and edge cases
- **ProjectTracking.e2e.test.tsx** - End-to-end user workflows
- **test-utils.tsx** - Shared testing utilities and helpers

## Test Scripts

The following npm scripts are available for running the ProjectTracking tests:

```bash
# Run all ProjectTracking tests
npm run test:project-tracking

# Run tests in watch mode (automatically rerun on changes)
npm run test:project-tracking:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:project-tracking:coverage

# Run tests with interactive UI
npm run test:project-tracking:ui
```

## What Is Tested

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Component rendering and basic UI elements
- ✅ Feature creation, editing, and deletion
- ✅ Subtask management (create, edit, delete, status changes)
- ✅ Notes system with auto-save functionality
- ✅ File attachment upload and management
- ✅ Bulk assignment operations
- ✅ Collaboration features (assignees, team members)
- ✅ Undo/redo functionality
- ✅ Search and filtering capabilities

### Drag and Drop
- ✅ Feature movement between columns (Ideas → Working → Pending → Done)
- ✅ Collision detection and drop target validation
- ✅ Invalid drop handling
- ✅ Drag state management and visual feedback
- ✅ Undo operations for drag movements
- ✅ Performance under rapid drag operations

### Advanced Scenarios
- ✅ Auto-save debouncing and conflict resolution
- ✅ Multiple concurrent auto-save operations
- ✅ Large dataset performance testing
- ✅ Memory leak prevention (timer cleanup)
- ✅ Error handling for network failures
- ✅ Browser compatibility (mobile touch events)
- ✅ Corrupted data recovery

### End-to-End Workflows
- ✅ New user experience and onboarding
- ✅ Product manager sprint planning workflow
- ✅ Developer daily standup workflow
- ✅ QA testing workflow
- ✅ Team collaboration scenarios
- ✅ Complete project lifecycle
- ✅ Error recovery scenarios

### Accessibility
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Screen reader announcements and ARIA labels
- ✅ High contrast mode compatibility
- ✅ Focus management during interactions

## Test Configuration

The tests use Vitest with the following configuration:

- **Environment**: jsdom (simulates browser environment)
- **Coverage Target**: 80% for ProjectTracking.tsx, 70% global
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds per test
- **Mocking**: Complete mocking of @dnd-kit libraries to test business logic

## Key Testing Patterns

### Mocking Strategy
The tests mock external dependencies like @dnd-kit to focus on testing the component's business logic rather than third-party library behavior:

```typescript
// Example: Mocking drag and drop to test movement logic
vi.mock('@dnd-kit/core', () => ({
  DndContext: ({ children, onDragEnd }) => {
    // Store handler to trigger in tests
    mockHandleDragEnd.mockImplementation(onDragEnd);
    return <div data-testid="dnd-context">{children}</div>;
  },
  // ... other mocks
}));
```

### Auto-Save Testing
Auto-save functionality is tested using fake timers to control timing:

```typescript
// Type in input
await user.type(textarea, 'Test content');

// Advance time to trigger auto-save
vi.advanceTimersByTime(1000);

// Verify save occurred
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(screen.getByText(/saving/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### File Upload Testing
File uploads are simulated without actual file operations:

```typescript
const file = testHelpers.createMockFile('test.pdf', 'application/pdf');
testHelpers.simulateFileUpload(fileInput, [file]);
```

## Coverage Requirements

The test suite enforces the following coverage thresholds:

- **ProjectTracking.tsx**: 80% (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- **Global**: 70% (branches, functions, lines, statements)

Coverage reports are generated in HTML format for detailed analysis.

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
Ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
npm install
```

### Basic Test Run
```bash
npm run test:project-tracking
```

### Watch Mode (Development)
```bash
npm run test:project-tracking:watch
```

### Coverage Analysis
```bash
npm run test:project-tracking:coverage
```

This generates an HTML coverage report in the `coverage/` directory.

### Interactive UI
```bash
npm run test:project-tracking:ui
```

Opens Vitest's web-based UI for interactive test running and debugging.

## Test Structure

Each test file follows a consistent structure:

```typescript
describe('Component/Feature Name', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup before each test
  });

  describe('Feature Group', () => {
    test('should do specific thing', async () => {
      // Arrange: Set up test data
      // Act: Perform user actions
      // Assert: Verify expected outcomes
    });
  });
});
```

## Debugging Tests

### Common Issues

1. **Async Operations**: Use `waitFor()` for asynchronous operations
2. **Timer-based Code**: Use `vi.advanceTimersByTime()` instead of real delays
3. **File Operations**: Use mock files, not real file system
4. **Network Requests**: Mock fetch/API calls

### Debug Mode
Run tests with verbose output:
```bash
npm run test:project-tracking -- --reporter=verbose
```

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
When adding new functionality to ProjectTracking:

1. Add corresponding tests to appropriate test file
2. Update test utilities if new patterns emerge
3. Ensure coverage thresholds are maintained
4. Update this documentation

### Test Philosophy
These tests focus on:
- **Functionality over implementation** - Tests verify what the component does, not how
- **User behavior** - Tests simulate real user interactions
- **Robustness** - Tests include edge cases and error scenarios
- **Performance** - Tests ensure the component performs well under load

This approach ensures the tests remain valuable even when the UI or internal implementation changes, fulfilling the requirement that "UI can change but all the functionalities we added if they change the tests will fail."

## Troubleshooting

### Test Failures
If tests fail after changes:

1. Check if functionality actually broke or if test needs updating
2. Review coverage report to identify untested code paths
3. Use test UI to debug specific test failures
4. Check browser console for runtime errors

### Performance Issues
If tests run slowly:

1. Use fake timers for time-based operations
2. Mock heavy external dependencies
3. Limit DOM queries in tight loops
4. Consider breaking large tests into smaller ones

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the test suite:

- [ ] Visual regression testing for UI consistency
- [ ] Integration tests with real backend APIs
- [ ] Cross-browser testing with Playwright
- [ ] Performance benchmarking over time
- [ ] Automated accessibility audits
