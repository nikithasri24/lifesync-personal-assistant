# LifeSync Development Workflow

## üöÄ **Pre-Development Checklist**

Before making ANY changes to the codebase:

```bash
# 1. Run regression tests to establish baseline
./regression-test.sh

# 2. Run full test suite for comprehensive check
./test-suite.sh

# 3. Verify current feature state
./health-check.sh
```

If any tests fail, fix them BEFORE making changes.

## üîÑ **Development Workflow**

### 1. **Feature Planning**
- [ ] Document the change in this file
- [ ] Identify affected components/pages
- [ ] List features that might be impacted
- [ ] Plan testing strategy

### 2. **Environment Setup**
```bash
# Ensure clean environment
./fix-api-connection.sh

# Verify everything works
./regression-test.sh
```

### 3. **Make Changes**
- [ ] Follow existing code patterns
- [ ] Update TypeScript types if needed
- [ ] Test changes locally as you go

### 4. **Testing During Development**
```bash
# Quick test after each major change
./regression-test.sh

# Check specific functionality
curl http://10.247.209.223:3001/api/health
```

### 5. **Pre-Commit Testing**
```bash
# Comprehensive testing before finalizing
./test-suite.sh

# Manual testing checklist
# - Drag & drop still works
# - CRUD operations persist
# - UI responsive on mobile
# - Theme switching works
# - No console errors
```

### 6. **Post-Change Verification**
- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing of affected features
- [ ] Browser console shows no errors
- [ ] App works on mobile view
- [ ] Database operations persist

---

## üéØ **Critical Features Protection**

### **NEVER BREAK THESE** (Test immediately after changes):

1. **Task Drag & Drop** - `src/pages/TodosWorkingFollowUp.tsx`
   ```bash
   # Test: Can you drag tasks between columns?
   # Test: Does order persist after refresh?
   ```

2. **Database CRUD Operations**
   ```bash
   # Test: Create, edit, delete tasks/habits
   # Test: Do changes persist after page refresh?
   curl http://10.247.209.223:3001/api/tasks
   ```

3. **API Connectivity**
   ```bash
   # Test: All API endpoints respond
   ./regression-test.sh | grep "API"
   ```

4. **Theme Switching**
   ```bash
   # Test: Dark/light mode toggle works
   # Test: Theme persists across page navigation
   ```

5. **Real-time Data Sync**
   ```bash
   # Test: Changes appear immediately in UI
   # Test: Data syncs to database
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Component-Specific Testing**

### When modifying `TodosWorkingFollowUp.tsx`:
```bash
# Critical tests:
# 1. Drag & drop between columns
# 2. Task creation/editing
# 3. Status changes persist
# 4. Project assignment works
# 5. Search/filter functions
```

### When modifying `Habits.tsx`:
```bash
# Critical tests:
# 1. Habit creation with all frequencies
# 2. Daily check-ins save
# 3. Progress visualization
# 4. Calendar view accuracy
# 5. Streak counting
```

### When modifying API services:
```bash
# Critical tests:
./test-suite.sh  # Full API endpoint testing
curl http://10.247.209.223:3001/api/health
```

### When modifying CSS/styling:
```bash
# Critical tests:
# 1. Responsive design on mobile
# 2. Theme switching works
# 3. Drag handles still visible
# 4. No layout breaks
```

---

## üö® **Emergency Rollback Procedure**

If you break something critical:

```bash
# 1. Stop all servers
pkill -f "vite"
pkill -f "node.*3001"

# 2. Reset environment
./fix-api-connection.sh

# 3. Check git status
git status

# 4. If needed, revert changes
git checkout -- problematic-file.tsx

# 5. Restart and test
./regression-test.sh
```

- [ ] Manual testing confirms affected features work
- [ ] No new browser console errors
- [ ] Mobile responsive design maintained
- [ ] Theme switching still works
- [ ] Database operations persist correctly
- [ ] Drag & drop functionality preserved (if applicable)
